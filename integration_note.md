## What Was Integrated

Two independent codebases — a **Python/FastAPI backend** and a **React/Vite frontend** — were unified into a single repository with deterministic end-to-end flow.

## What Was Added

1. **7 New Backend Endpoints** (`backend/api/router.py`)
   - `GET /nyaya/case_summary` — Summarised query response
   - `GET /nyaya/legal_routes` — Processing route + procedural steps
   - `GET /nyaya/timeline` — Procedural timeline with ETAs
   - `GET /nyaya/glossary` — Legal term definitions
   - `GET /nyaya/jurisdiction_info` — Static jurisdiction metadata (IN/UK/UAE/KSA)
   - `GET /nyaya/enforcement_status` — Enforcement decision details
   - `POST /nyaya/rl_signal` — RL feedback ingestion → RewardEngine

2. **ResponseCache** (`backend/api/router.py`)
   - Thread-safe LRU cache (500 entries) keyed by `trace_id`
   - Every `/nyaya/query` response is cached for downstream endpoint consumption

3. **Environment Templates**
   - `backend/.env.example` — All backend config vars documented
   - `frontend/.env.example` — Frontend env template

4. **Documentation Suite**
   - `DISCLOSURE_REPORT.md` — Full 253-file system analysis
   - `INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` — 5-phase plan
   - `system_map.md` — Module map, entry points, all endpoints
   - `final_decision_contract.json` — Canonical decision object schema
   - `REVIEW_PACKET.md` — Mandatory review deliverable

## What Was Merged

- Frontend `DecisionPage.jsx` → redirected from hardcoded `nyayaBackendApi.js` to unified `nyayaApi.js`
- Backend CORS → specific origins + configurable `FRONTEND_URL` env var
- Ledger paths → configurable via `ENFORCEMENT_LEDGER_PATH` and `PROVENANCE_LEDGER_PATH` env vars

## What Was Removed

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `backend/api/router_broken.py` | Stale broken backup |
| `frontend/src/App_Old_Backup.jsx` | Old backup |
| `frontend/src/App_New.jsx` | Unused |
| `frontend/src/components/LegalQueryCard_BACKUP.jsx` | Empty 29-byte backup |
| `backend/frontend/` | Empty directory |
| `backend/venv/` | Excluded from git (was being tracked) |
| `backend/__pycache__/` | Excluded from git |
| `backend/.env` | Excluded from git (contains secrets) |

## What Was NOT Changed

All existing working modules were preserved:
- `clean_legal_advisor.py` — Untouched
- `enforcement_engine/` — Untouched (all 9 rules)
- `governed_execution/pipeline.py` — Untouched
- `rl_engine/reward_engine.py` — Untouched
- `services/retriever.py` — Untouched (BM25 + FAISS hybrid)
- `services/reranker.py` — Untouched
- All 52 legal DB files — Untouched
- All 48 frontend components — Untouched (except DecisionPage import fix)

## Key Design Decision

All 7 new endpoints **read from the ResponseCache** rather than re-executing queries. This ensures:
- Zero additional compute cost
- Consistent data (same response as the original query)
- Sub-millisecond response times for downstream calls
- Thread-safe concurrent access
